# Vintage Treasure Ltd Website

This is a static website for Vintage Treasure Ltd, a procurement and supply chain company. The site is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages and includes:

- Responsive navigation and layout
- Product grid with modal details
- Contact section with map and quick actions
- Modern, accessible HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

**Note:** The `.nojekyll` file ensures that GitHub Pages does not process your site with Jekyll, which is important for static sites with folders/files starting with underscores or using custom routing.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – Main HTML file
- `styles.css` – Site styles
- `script.js` – JavaScript for interactivity
- `.nojekyll` – Prevents Jekyll processing

## Customization
- Update product details, contact info, and company description in `index.html` as needed.
- Adjust styles in `styles.css` for branding.
- Extend interactivity in `script.js` if required.
